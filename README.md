## Objective:
The Attendance System project aims to optimize attendance management in educational institutions by providing a user-friendly and efficient solution. Key features include easy attendance marking for teachers, student self-marking with teacher approval, and comprehensive attendance reporting and analytics. The system will seamlessly integrate with existing school systems and offer a website for convenient access on the go. With a focus on simplifying the attendance process and providing valuable insights, the Attendance System seeks to contribute to improved educational outcomes and student success. The project will follow a collaborative development approach, incorporating feedback from teachers, students, and administrators to ensure that the system meets their needs effectively.
